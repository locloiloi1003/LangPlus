Our goal is to create a transparent and reliable learning system where students can track their progress and achievements through on-chain records.  

## Features
- On-chain record of student achievements  
- Tokenized reward system (LPL Token)  
- Transparent and immutable credential verification  
- Demo application for showcasing learning progress  

## Tech Stack
- Blockchain / Web3  
- Rust / Solidity (for smart contracts)  
- React (for demo application)  

## Progress
Currently, we have completed the project design and token creation.  
The next step is to integrate smart contracts with a simple demo application to showcase how learning records and achievements can be stored and verified on-chain.
